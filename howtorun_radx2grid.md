# Radx2Grid

Radx2Grid performs coordinate transformations from the polar grid on which radar data is collected to a regular grid.

The following regular grids are supported:

- Cartesian grid in (Z,Y,X)
- PPI grid in (EL, Y, Z) - performs Cartesian transformation on each elevation angle separately
- Polar grid, regular in (EL, AZ, RANGE)
